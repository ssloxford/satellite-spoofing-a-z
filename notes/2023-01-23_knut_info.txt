E.g. for Ka Band, rain is a major impairment... But Ka is very
attractive in terms of capacity, also for LEO earth
observation satellites, whose high-resolution sensors these days can
easily overwhelm an X-Band downlink.

Atmospheric channel simulator for the simulation of propagation
impairments for Ka band data downlink

Questions:
Are you looking at specific satellite links, like LEO S or L-band or
more GEO Ku/Ka?
