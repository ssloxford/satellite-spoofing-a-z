* ESA informal risk evaluations on downlink spoofing
    and how this work might help formalise the process

what would be useful to formalise the process?
    * outline the cost model for the attacker in terms of hardware procurement
    * how far can you stay away from the station - the perimeter is seen as protected
        so if we can show that <20k cost means you can be further than 1km, that's an issue
        in Holland, max dish size you can have is 2.5m across
        if you try to procure a larger antenna, eyebrows are raised
    * classify the attacker and risk models, motivated amateurs
        classify risk to commercial operations
        the nation state attack is clearly known
        and evaluated rigorously

        make a point of protecting downlink data
            commercial losses
            frequency surveillance possible, integrity and 

        classified when loss-of-life involved, processes surround that
        

Starting point: the judgment was that groundstations are geographically isolated, so driving a van up there within 1km would be obvious from physical presence
More jamming consideration: 
Decision made early on to encrypt the downlink - which ones?
    it's a gov project - security thinking of risk avoidance at the start
    legal mandate forced their hand
        satellite systems that collect EOS of a certian resolution, high value, then the downlink has to be protected, evaluated by BSI comsec of Germany, as if it were restricted data - lowest level of gov classification

downlink: mainly that Implementing crypto costs a lot of money
uplink: safety experts fiercely opposed to losing control, as it's a point of failure
    this can be overcome by holding to the same rigorous safety standards as the computer decoding the commands
    it's a historic fear
    CCSDS standardisation TM encryption aims to reduce cost points

Every mission has differnet pain/cost points, and depends on gs capabilities
gs has spectrum analyser - how used?
    has built-in decoder modules

longer observation times would be needed to characterise contributions to nonlinearity
atmospheric conditions change, and satellite amps are sometimes nonlinear near saturation point

experienced gs engineer might be able to detect it

so in general, no detection is done for this
    so attackers don't need to be too stealthy atm for short-term attacks

countermeasures being taken:
    * diagnose jamming (unintentional sometimes)
    * carrier ID - normal signal overlaid by weak spread spectrum, like a phone number to call
    * not seen in the downlink, because requires dedicated hardware

recommend: identify overshadowing by adding physical layer to legit signal
    drives cost factor up for the attacker

drones being considered flying 1-2km above gs - not in signal path,
RF direction finding devices being proposed - are they implemented?

* channel modelling and its relation to the threat model
    how in-depth do we need - e.g. the papers sent through, or just free space path loss
    do any recei

This is very hard to say in general. Ground stations may also employ
a separate multi-segment antenna tied to a frequency monitoring
system which would be capable of detecting RF energy arriving at
"angles" which do not match elevation+azimuth from the expected
satellite source.

It depends on the type of ground station - specifics of space systems

* RF experiments on additional frequencies
    X-band is good - many EOS downlink in X-band, so it's representative
    the latest ones downlink in Ka because they downlink so much data
        this is where the trend is going
    telecommand S-band, moving to X or K

* we really run the experiment
    main thing is scaling - size of a real-world X-band ground station is unknown
        but the theory of the parabolic dish is well-known, we scale and arrive at same characteristics

    can emulate tracking

    needs to be a dish for sure
    continuous tracking

    a more complex modulation scheme gives the legitimate owner a higher observability - you can see the nonlinearlities more easily, phase dependencies seen more easily
    today's EOS use this - you're talking 600Mbit at downlink   
    QPSK or higher

* uplink qs
    we'd have to look at
    if you decide not to protect, you have to consider a malicious command by talking to it over another country

    overshadowing - when you have a legitimate lock
        so you'd immediate commands
        how would the groundstation detect the loss of a lock
        you'd do a frequency sweep

    talented amateurs - what can they do?

    if it's a cubesat that doesn't have propulsion, then you don't have to care
        the country you launch from takes responsibility

    paper's less useful

* experiment of brute-forcing TC packets
    more expensive satellites have electrical protections, like failures
        there's multiple redundancies, and there are no telecommands to disconnect from supply
    Chatham house - made bizarre claims like orienting solar arrays to damage them, which was nonsense
    the amount of physical damage is limited, until propulsion systems involved
    empty propellant to end the satellite's life
    everything else has to be continuous
        implement telecommand protection


our paper: systematising the risk evaluation of
> overshadowing attacks, and an exploration of countermeasures.

he likes the idea of economic complexities on attacking and defending side

potential French partner in channel modelling and amplifiers etc.

- coding gain qs
    the difference between overshadowing and jamming
    he's seen back-of-envelope reasoning - if the decoder has a lock, then you need multiple dbs to obtain the lock on the other transmission
        need to compare to other
        in GNSS you're below the noise floor so it's more possible
            how you slowly increase signal power to take over, to lift off other signal
            how to gently insert yourself

- modulation gain
- antenna attenuation
- other protocol features


If we want to make impact, keep commercial attacks/defence in mind, without gov agency doing electronic warfare
    gives a good feel for terrorists, for example

Follow-on:
* whether SDRs can be used to build detection modules at the ground station, looking at constellation plot distortions
