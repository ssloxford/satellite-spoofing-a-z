Terra/Aqua (QPSK)
Received gain: -151.8
Receiver noise:

Coding offset: 2, 11

Antenna attenuation (worst):
Antenna attenuation (sidelobe):


Receiver noise temperature
Terra/Aqua main GS: 155.0 K
Cryocooling: 60K
Room temperature: 273K
Pretty hot: 360K

GPS?


Modulation offset table

Modulation scheme, receiver noise temperature, *receiver noise, EaEvdB cutoff

#

Assume thermal noise of 300K

Maths:




TODO:
/ get the bit rate for each satellite system into the table
* add antenna polar plot theoretical values to attenuation table (discuss with Marcell as he had ideas)
* consider getting more theoretical gain patterns in there


* pseudocode to show how noise temp is converted to the EaEbdB threshold
* thermal noise table, leading to modulation offset
* add receiver dish sizes to satellite table
