> in practice, the whole payload is considered as erroneous and therefore rejected (i.e. not forwarded to the network) if any constituting bit is badly decoded

# Modulation schemes

## Analog carrier
### Analog data
* AM - e.g. APT satellites
* FM - e.g. voice radio relays
* PM - e.g. voice relays in theory

### Digital data
* ASK
* PSK
* APSK
* QAM
* FSK

## Digital carrier
### Analog data
* PAM
* PWM
* PPM

### Digital data
* PCM


Any signal where the amplitude matters (locked on to some carrier) is harder to subtly inject just a few bits - whole packets probably have to be replaced
This includes:

* AM
* APSK
* QAM

Differential schemes also have issues, as the attacker's data may be misinterpreted:
* CPM

## Commonly-used satellite ones

* AM - e.g. APT
* FM - e.g. voice

Digital comms systems:
* ASK
* FSK
* QAM

* BPSK
* QPSK
* 8PSK

These are most resistant to nonlinear amplification - constant envelope

* PSK and its derivatives

What do DVBS-2 satellites use?
Iridium?

Two challenges:
* locking on to sync header
    in the CADU the sync header won't be detected if it's at all different to normal I think, which could lead to subtle jamming
* decoding data within checksum correctability


Things to do:
* validate that the NASA simulator isn't able to correct errors in the header
* GNURadio simulation for different PSKs, getting out the BER as corresponds to different overshadow factors
* different protocols, understand the max BER that can be handled through sync headers and hamming codes
* build table of protocol/modulation scheme


This is for whole-packet injection only

We estimate that the attacker's signal feels like a "noisy channel" to them given the legit transmission

BER - the probability that, for a given bit, that bit is flipped
assume bit flips are independent events

Modulation - map overshadow factor to BER
Protocol - map BER to probability of packet decoding
