    this code used a lot in the DVB environment
    "has mature implementations in silicon that closely approximate the theoretical performance predicted for the code"
    "been shown to yield results that very closely approximate simulation results"

This provides the "union bound" on the sequence error rate, and graphs the standard bound vs the improved bound

Some of the values of Cd are found in (but confusingly not all, and there are three tables that seem the same but are also different?):
